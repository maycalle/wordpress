Installing WordPress is usually an easy process, especially if you use tools and services that make it simple. WordPress has a large community of users and is plenty of online guides. If you have any problems during the installation, you can find solutions and answers in support forums or specialized blogs.

## 1. WordPress Installation Types

There are several ways to install WordPress, depending on your needs and preferences.

* **Manual installation:** This method involves downloading the WordPress files from the official website (wordpress.org/download), setting up a database, and uploading the files via FTP (*File Transfer Protocol*) to the web hosting server. Then the initial configuration is done and the installation is completed using the WordPress wizard.
* **Local Installation:** You can install WordPress on your local computer for development and testing purposes using software like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, which creates a local server environment on your machine. After setting up the environment, you can download the WordPress files and install just like you would on a remote server.
* **Installation with a one-click installer:** Many web hosts offer one-click installers, such as Softaculous or Fantastico, that simplify the installation process. You just need to access the control panel of your web hosting account, search for WordPress in the list of available applications and follow the steps to install it automatically.
* **Cloud installation:** Some cloud service providers, such as *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* or *Google Cloud Platform (GCP)*, offer services that allow you to create and configure a virtual server to install WordPress. These options typically require a bit more technical knowledge and configuration, but provide flexibility and scalability.

## 2. Installation process

Before installing WordPress, you need to check that your web hosting provider fulfills the necessary software and conditions. Also, you must have access to the server and some tools.

**Requirements on the server side**
* PHP 7.4 or greater
* MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.3 or greater
* HTTPS support

**Requirements on local**
* Login Account (user id and password) to the server via FTP or shell
* Text Editor
* FTP program to upload files to the server. You could choose FileZilla for this task.
* Your web browser of choice


### 2.1 Domain purchase, hosting and requirements

Before installing Wordpress, you must buy a domain on a server or service hosting (that allows PHP and MySQL). You can also install it on a local server (for example, XAMPP or similar) to test before publishing the final version on the server where you have contracted the domain. 

#### 2.1.1 Registration in Trinchera DEV

[Trinchera DEV](https://trincheradev.com/) offers free hosting for WordPress pages. Free accounts have the following limitations:
* Each user can only create one WordPress site
* Each site has a maximum space of 512MB
* Each site has a MySQL database
* PHP memory limit is 128Mb for each site

Also, you should keep in mind that all pages that are not active for 14 days will be deactivated. After 30 days, the deactivated pages will be removed from their servers.

To finish the process, you must confirm the registration from a link that will be sent to the email that you have indicated in the registration form. 

#### 2.1.2 Create a site on Trinchera DEV

Once you have completed the registration successfully, log in and click on the **`Create a site`** option and follow these steps:

1. Enter a **title** and **name** for your website.

</div>

2. Click on the **`Show advanced options`** button. There you can choose between a *clean install* and a *guided installation*. In the clean install you can upload your files via FTP and in the guided installation you can follow a step-by-step process and choose the plugins, theme, and other options you want to install. In this case, we are going to perform a **clean installation**. To do this, uncheck the **`Install WordPress`** option from the *advanced options* and

</div>   

3. Press the **`Create site`** button to finish. This process may take a few minutes.

</div>

4. You can view your site by clicking on **`Sites`** from the menu on the left. Here appears information about the site such as its name, the server, its status, its creation date and a drop-down button with the actions that we can perform on the site.

</div>

The actions you can perform are the following:

* **Information:** provides basic details about your site such as the name, URL, status, mysql user, and more. 
* **Open site:** by clicking on this option, your WordPress main page will open in a new browser tab. 
* **Open WP-Admin:** this option takes you to the WordPress administration panel (WP-Admin) of your site. It's the place where you can perform management tasks, add content, install themes and plugins, configure settings, and more.
* **Correct permissions:** sometimes, file and directory permissions may not be configured correctly. This option helps you correct the necessary file and directory permissions for WordPress to work properly.
* **Create and download Ai1 Backup:** allows you to create and download a complete backup of your website. The backup includes all files, the database, and the WordPress configuration. It's a good practice to regularly back up your site to protect it from potential data loss.
* **Migrate WordPress to Arsys:**  enables you to migrate your WordPress site from Trinchera Dev to Arsys, another hosting provider. It helps you move your site from one environment to another without losing important data or settings.
* **Search and replace:** sometimes, you may need to search and replace specific texts or links on your WordPress website. This option allows you to efficiently make changes throughout your site's content, avoiding the need to manually edit each page or post.
* **Change WordPress user passwords:** with this option, you can change the passwords of the users on your WordPress site. It's useful if you forget your password or if you want to update it for security reasons.
* **Pause site:** allows you to temporarily put your site in maintenance mode. It displays a *'Site under maintenance'* page to visitors and allows you to perform updates or changes without users seeing the modifications in real-time.
* **Notes:** you can add notes or comments for yourself or other site administrators. You can use it to document relevant information, keep track of changes made, or provide additional instructions for site maintenance.
* **Disk space used:** shows the disk space used by your website on Trinchera Dev. It can be useful for monitoring your site's size and ensuring that it doesn't exceed the storage limits provided by your hosting provider.
* **Delete:** this action will delete all files and the associated database of the site, so make sure to have backups before performing this operation.

If you click on the *`Open site`* action, nothing will appear. If you click on the *`Open WP-Admin`* action, you will see an error message like this: *"Not Found. The requested URL /wp-admin was not found on this server"*. This happens because you haven't downloaded WordPress or uploaded it via FTP to Trinchera DEV yet. We will see this in the next section.

### 2.2 Download from Wordpress and upload to the server

Download and unzip the WordPress package from [`wordpress.org/download/`](https://wordpress.org/download/).
